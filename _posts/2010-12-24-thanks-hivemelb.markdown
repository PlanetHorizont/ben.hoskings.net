title: "thanks, hivemelb"

Back in mid-November, [@nathan_scott](http://twitter.com/nathan_scott) [spoke at The Hive](http://thehive.org.au/nathan-sampimon-from-inspire9/) about his experiences founding [Inspire9](http://twitter.com/inspire9) as a freelance web developer.

Someone at the event took it upon themselves to pinch my iPad. But through the generosity of the Hive attendees, I have a new one. So this post is definitely overdue, but better late than never, right?

The iPad was sitting more or less in front of me on the stage; I was deep in conversation with Mikala of [@MiFAgallery](http://twitter.com/MiFAgallery). I happened to notice someone stand up and walk away from just next to where it was sitting, and something about it made me check my iPad was still there---which it wasn't. I glanced about to see if anyone had moved it, and by the time I turned around to spot the potential thief, they were gone.

I darted down to the street, but couldn't see them there either. So I ran back upstairs and told [@pat](http://twitter.com/pat); we grabbed his laptop, fired up [Find My iPad](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/find-my-iphone.html), and there it was, moving along the street about a block away.

In my naïveté I thought it might be a good idea to send a message to the iPad. (You can do that with Find My iPad). So I said to the thief that if they reconsidered and brought it back, I'd really appreciate it, along with my phone number and email. That obviously really helped.

By this time [@kealey](http://twitter.com/kealey) had joined in and was [tweeting](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4475673116672000) [like](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4475681270403072) [a](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4476389864505344) [champ](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4477571194421248). I loaded up Find My iPad on my iPhone and headed down to the street while Kealey and Nathan tracked the iPad's progress on Pat's laptop. We saw it head north from The Order of Melbourne along Elizabeth and onto Royal Parade, along the 19 tram route. Soon it began to move at a tram-like speed. Unbeknownst to me, Hive founder [@lukemccormack](http://twitter.com/lukemccormack) had jumped in a cab and was following the tram up the road. I was on the phone with the police, saying "I can see exactly where they are on a map".

Our pursuit of the thief was looking promising, with surveillance HQ at The Order, me on foot, and Luke in a taxi in hot pursuit. But then suddenly, the iPad disappeared from my MobileMe account. (That's what happens if you delete the account from the iPad, or wipe it.) And that was it; there was nothing more we could do. I headed back to the order and changed my passwords. (I made a proper police report later that evening too, but haven't heard anything yet.)

Luke was really apologetic that something like that would happen at his event. But I doubt anyone would think badly of The Hive because of something like this---I certainly don't. At a public event, you get the public, which I reckon is made up almost entirely of nice people, punctuated with wankers. :)

The next bit was unexpected and awesome. The next morning, I was chatting with Nath and he nonchalantly dropped a question or two.

Luke and The Hive organised [a pledgie](http://pledgie.com/campaigns/13960) via twitter. Donations started coming in from lovely people all over twitter who'd seen the chatter. All told, over the following couple of days the Hive community donated practically enough to buy me a new iPad, which really humbled me. I don't feel like I deserved such amazing generosity.

Later that week, I had a new iPad.

I believe that the best way to react to something so disproportionately nice is to pay it forward. Also, I'm keenly aware of the fact that in the scheme of things I'm pretty affluent. I wouldn't call myself rich, but then that word means a different thing to what it once did. The fact that I can easily afford a device like an iPad in the first place means that I'm within the top couple of percentage points worldwide, income-wise. (If the screen you're reading this on is yours, then you probably are too.) And so, in the spirit of generosity that replaced my iPad, and also in the style of the season, I'd like to give an iPad's worth of cash to . There are a few worthy targets I can think of---but I think it'd be nicer if you decide the cause.

You can vote for the cause of your choice by clicking its name. Or if there's one in particular that you think others would like to vote for too, you can type its name and hit enter (keep it short or it'll be rejected). Voting is totally anonymous and so it's pretty gameable, but, you know, don't do that please. :)

<div id="vote">
  <ul class="results">
  </ul>
</div>

I'll leave the voting up over Christmas and New Year's, and then make a donation in early 2011. If there's a clear favourite I'll send all the cash their way; if it's too close to call I'll split it between the leaders. So, vote away! And tell your twitter-, web- and iPad-loving friends.

Lastly, thanks once again to all you lovely people from The Hive who generously donated a piece of my new iPad. I'm really grateful for it.
