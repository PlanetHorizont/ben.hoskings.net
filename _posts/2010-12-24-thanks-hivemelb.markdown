As some of you will remember, back in mid-November, [@nathan_scott](http://twitter.com/nathan_scott) [spoke at The Hive](http://thehive.org.au/nathan-sampimon-from-inspire9/) about his experiences founding [Inspire9](http://twitter.com/inspire9) as a freelance web developer.

So this post is definitely overdue, but better late than never, right?

Someone at the event took it upon themselves to pinch my iPad. It was sitting more or less in front of me on the stage while I was deep in conversation with Mikala of [@MiFAgallery](http://twitter.com/MiFAgallery). I happened to notice someone stand up and walk away from just next to where it was sitting, and something about it made me check my iPad was still thereâ€¦ which it wasn't. By the time I'd glanced about to see if anyone had moved it, and looked around to see where they were, they were gone.

I darted down to the street, but couldn't see them there either. So I ran back upstairs and told [@pat](http://twitter.com/pat); we grabbed his laptop and fired up [Find My iPad](http://www.apple.com/mobileme/features/find-my-iphone.html). Until then I wasn't really sure that someone had nicked it; I thought maybe a mate had put it in their bag for me, but there it was, moving along the street about a block away.

By this point [@kealey](http://twitter.com/kealey) had joined the hunt and started [tweeting](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4475673116672000) [like](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4475681270403072) [a](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4476389864505344) [champ](http://twitter.com/kealey/status/4477571194421248). We saw the iPad head north from The Order of Melbourne along Elizabeth, and onto Royal Parade along the 19 tram route.
