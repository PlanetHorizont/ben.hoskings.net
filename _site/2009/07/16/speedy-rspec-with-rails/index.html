        </h1>
      </header>
      <p>So rails rspec runs are really slow to start up. There are two reasons why:</p>
      
      <ul>
      <li>Rails is initialised each time, which takes a few seconds</li>
      
      <li><code>db:test:prepare</code> runs before each run, which is another complete rails initialisation in itself</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>These delays don&#8217;t have anything to do with rspec. It&#8217;s just the nature of the Rails framework—there&#8217;s a lot of ruby to load, to get the framework off the ground. These tweaks don&#8217;t make that process any faster, they avoid it&#8212;firstly by removing a rails initialisation, and then by moving the delay of another away from each rspec run.</p>
      
      <p>To fix the first, install <a href='http://wiki.github.com/dchelimsky/rspec/spork-autospec-pure-bdd-joy'>spork</a> and configure it in <code>spec/spec_helper.rb</code>. Spork keeps an instance of your app running, and listens for connections from a spork-aware <code>rake spec</code> run. This removes the Rails startup delay more or less completely, since when you run <code>rake spec</code>, spork has your app ready and waiting to run specs transparently via DRb.</p>
      
      <p>As for the second, I don&#8217;t see any need to run <code>db:test:prepare</code> before every run when transactional fixtures are being used. It&#8217;s simple to disable. Change this</p>
      
      <pre><code>Spec::Rake::SpecTask.new(:spec =&gt; spec_prereq) do |t|</code></pre>
      
      <p>to this</p>
      
      <pre><code>Spec::Rake::SpecTask.new(:spec) do |t|</code></pre>
      
      <p>in <code>lib/tasks/rspec.rake</code>.</p>
      
      <p>With <code>db:test:prepare</code> and its subtasks not running, spork there&#8217;s less than a second of delay before specs start running. In my book, that&#8217;s close to fast enough to pleasantly run, and get results in realtime. Coupled with autotest, this should mean much snappier pass/fail feedback too.</p>
      
      <p>It seems messy to me to have those tasks defined within the app. In fact, most of the rails testing / speccing setup seems to involve just spraying messy generated code around the place. I think this is an example of something done wrong in spite of the fact that the tests may be passing.</p>
      
      <p>Next, to make ⌘R spec runs in TextMate spork-aware, head to the TextMate preferences and add <code>--drb</code> to the <code>TM_RSPEC_OPTS</code> variable (creating it if required). I also had to patch the <code>spec_mate</code> helper <a href='http://github.com/benhoskings/ruby-rspec.tmbundle/commit/c70b16106cd5ba74e97cc967d0e8f307850cbd28'>like so</a>.</p>
      
      <p>Running through spork causes a bit of a performance hit, too&#8212;it eliminates the startup delay, but the specs run slower, since there&#8217;s a DRb back and forth involved for each one. Spork is for running a few tests at a time, or for running through autotest, while you&#8217;re developing. When you run your full suite, you should stop the spork listener and run them locally at full speed.</p>
