        <h2 class="title">minimal menu bar</h2>
        <p>After reading <a href='http://www.rosshill.com.au/article/minimal-mac-menubar/'>Ross Hill&#8217;s post</a> about his minimal OS X menubar, I decided I&#8217;d try it on mine. I&#8217;m picky about these things, so I think my menu bar looked pretty good to start with, but it was busy.</p>
        
        <p><img src='/images/minimal-menubar-before.png' alt='menubar, before' /></p>
        
        <p>So I started looking, and thought, well there are a couple of things I can remove, but no, I use almost all of that stuff!</p>
        
        <p>With Ross&#8217; help though (i.e. him telling me I was wrong), I pared it down to something that I think is looking pretty good.</p>
        
        <p><img src='/images/minimal-menubar-after.png' alt='menubar, after' /></p>
        
        <p>All the stuff left I actually really do use a lot. In particular, the CPU/memory/network meters are really useful to tell what&#8217;s going on with the system, when I&#8217;m writing code and running specs etc, I use them constantly.</p>
        
        <p>A nice improvement I&#8217;ve noticed already is that now Tweetie is only visible in my Dock (which is hidden), I&#8217;m not constantly distracted by new tweets. When that little icon turns blue, I can&#8217;t help but click it. Marking the hidden dock icon on mentions and DMs, and then checking it periodically, when I think to, is much less disruptive.</p>
        
        <p>Cheers Ross :)</p>
