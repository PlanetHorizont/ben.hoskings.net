Model scopes are a neat way of stacking up querying logic, keeping it composable. One thing I've often wanted for, though, is a way to use those scopes in other contexts.

Usually when I level up as a developer, it's because of well-timed stubbornness.

I think "eyes on the prize" is very important (in this case, shipping it). There are more rabbit holes out there than any one of us can ever leap into.

Having said that, I've always tried to push on those wants: sometimes it's better to say "no, there is a better way", and make finding that way a blocker.
