There may well be some on the left in the US who misappropriate science to further their agenda. But I don't think it's a movement with any momentum,
[as Michael Shermer claims for SciAm](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-liberals-war-on-science):

> Believe it or not—and I suspect most readers will not—there's a liberal war on science. Say what?

Well, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence.

> The left's war on science begins with the stats cited above: 41 percent of Democrats are young Earth creationists, and 19 percent doubt that Earth is getting warmer.

This has nothing to do with Democrats: [46% of Americans are young Earth creationists](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/americans-believe-in-creationism_n_1571127.html), and [34% of Americans don't take climate change seriously](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/11/09/1170901/rasmussen-poll-68-percent-of-american-voters-see-global-warming-as-a-serious-problem/?mobile=nc). It's not the left rejecting evolution and climate science: it's Americans in general, skewed sharply towards the right.

> [Alex B. Berezow and Hank Campbell] contend that progressive liberals tend to be antinuclear because of the waste-disposal problem, anti–fossil fuels because of global warming, antihydroelectric because dams disrupt river ecosystems, and anti–wind power because of avian fatalities. The underlying current is “everything natural is good” and “everything unnatural is bad.”

Firstly, the political left and environmental zealots are two distinct groups.

Secondly, I don't think there are many people, even in the latter camp, who are actually opposing all forms of power generation. Many have strong opinions for one, or against another; the reality is that we don't yet know how we'll make enough clean power for the world. Lumping all of that into "the left want to ignore science because it's unnatural" is a wild swerve of reasoning.

> Whereas conservatives obsess over the purity and sanctity of sex, the left's sacred values seem fixated on the environment.

To equate these two things is to fundamentally misunderstand the scale of both. The conservative right's presence in American bedrooms and sex-ed classes is rabid and hugely powerful. It's internally inconsistent (for example, the anti-abortion movement [really should be for free birth control](http://esciencenews.com/articles/2012/10/04/abortion.rates.plummet.with.free.birth.control)). The sexually conservative right inflicts human damage on a vast scale.

There are certainly militant environmentalists too. I'm sure there are some that are sufficiently rabid, and I'm sure they have their own inconsistencies. But you don't need an opinion about their actions to see that they're a distinct group to "the Left"---and that they're a blip compared to the religious right.

> Try having a conversation with a liberal progressive about GMOs—genetically modified organisms—in which the words “Monsanto” and “profit” are not dropped like syllogistic bombs. [...] The fact is that we've been genetically modifying organisms for 10,000 years through breeding and selection. It's the only way to feed billions of people.

Another equation of two utterly distinct things. One can be a supporter of GM crops and at the same time condemn Monsanto for its [legal barbarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#Legal_actions_and_controversies). To claim that an opponent of Monsanto must also be against GM crops is to claim that an opponent of battery cages must also be a vegan.

> Surveys show that moderate liberals and conservatives embrace science roughly equally (varying across domains), which is why scientists like E. O. Wilson and organizations like the National Center for Science Education are reaching out to moderates in both parties to rein in the extremists on evolution and climate change.

And the false equivalence reaches a triumphant crescendo.

Movement conservatives, whether their fervent views are on guns, god, sex, the ecomony, or science, are a big slice of the Republican party---it's not an overstatement to say that they've overrun it.

I'm sure there are plenty of cherry-pickable examples of extremism on the left. But a movement it is not.
