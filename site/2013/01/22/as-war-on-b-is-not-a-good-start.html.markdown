It's certainly an eye-grabbing title: "The Liberals' War on Science". It's not just the right putting the boot in, [claims Michael Shermer for Scientific American](http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=the-liberals-war-on-science)---apparently science is distorted by both ends of the political spectrum.

> Believe it or not—and I suspect most readers will not—there's a liberal war on science. Say what?

Well, extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence. There may well be some on the left in the US who misappropriate science to further their agenda. Equating their scientific interference with that of movement conservatism, though, is quite a bow to draw.

> The left's war on science begins with the stats [from a 2011 survey by the Public Religion Research Institute]: 41 percent of Democrats are young Earth creationists, and 19 percent doubt that Earth is getting warmer.

This has nothing to do with Democrats: [46% of all Americans are young Earth creationists](http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/05/americans-believe-in-creationism_n_1571127.html), and [34% don't take climate change seriously](http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2012/11/09/1170901/rasmussen-poll-68-percent-of-american-voters-see-global-warming-as-a-serious-problem/?mobile=nc). In fact, according to [a survey by the same institute Shermer cites](http://publicreligion.org/research/2011/09/climate-change-evolution-2012/), Democrats are slightly more likely to accept both evolution and climate change than the average voter.

It's not the left that's rejecting evolution and climate science: it's a subset of all Americans, biased strongly towards the right.

> [Alex B. Berezow and Hank Campbell] contend that progressive liberals tend to be antinuclear because of the waste-disposal problem, anti–fossil fuels because of global warming, antihydroelectric because dams disrupt river ecosystems, and anti–wind power because of avian fatalities. The underlying current is “everything natural is good” and “everything unnatural is bad.”

Firstly, the political left and the environmental movement are two distinct groups, although there's surely overlap, as with any two nets cast as wide as those.

Secondly, I don't think there are many people, even in the latter group, who actually oppose all these methods of power generation at once. Many have strong opinions for one, or against another. Nuclear power is probably the most contentious of that list, and yet [Republican voters are only 15% more likely to favour domesic nuclear](http://www.gallup.com/poll/153452/americans-favor-nuclear-power-year-fukushima.aspx), with one in two Democratic voters favouring it.

Finally, I think the underlying current that Berezow and Campbell think they've detected says a lot more about them and their view of progressive liberals than it does about progressive liberals themselves.

> Whereas conservatives obsess over the purity and sanctity of sex, the left's sacred values seem fixated on the environment.

Once again, the left and the envioronmental movement aren't the same thing. But that aside, I found the false equivalence of this statement jarring, if for no other reason than the sheer difference of scale. The conservative right's presence in American bedrooms and Sex Ed classes is rabid and hugely powerful. The sexually conservative right inflicts human damage on a vast scale.

There are certainly radical environmentalists, too. But to whatever extent they exist with comparable fervour, it doesn't compare to the conservative right's influence over [public education](http://www.ucsusa.org/scientific_integrity/abuses_of_science/abstinence-only-education.html) and [foreign aid](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexico_City_Policy), to give just two examples.

You don't need an opinion about environmental zealots to see that they're a distinct group to "the Left"---and that in influencing policy, they're a blip compared to the religious right.

> Try having a conversation with a liberal progressive about GMOs—genetically modified organisms—in which the words “Monsanto” and “profit” are not dropped like syllogistic bombs. [...] The fact is that we've been genetically modifying organisms for 10,000 years through breeding and selection. It's the only way to feed billions of people.

Another equation of two utterly distinct things. One can be a supporter of GM crops and at the same time condemn Monsanto for its [legal barbarism](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monsanto#Legal_actions_and_controversies). To claim that an opponent of Monsanto must also be against GM crops is to claim that an opponent of battery cages must also be a vegan.

> Surveys show that moderate liberals and conservatives embrace science roughly equally (varying across domains), which is why scientists like E. O. Wilson and organizations like the National Center for Science Education are reaching out to moderates in both parties to rein in the extremists on evolution and climate change.

At this point, the false equivalence reaches a triumphant crescendo.

As for "extremists on evolution and climate change", I can only guess. Perhaps those who would have evolution taught without creationism alongside, and who would have climate change taught as a scientific reality. That group would include me, and the editors of SciAm too, not to mention reasonable "extremists" everywhere.

Movement conservatives, whether their fervent views are on guns, god, sex, the ecomony, or science, are a big slice of the Republican party---it's not an overstatement to say that they've overrun it. There's no such movement on the left. Cherry-pickable examples, sure; but to
