An auspicious day indeed---20 years ago today, in 1993, Matz started work on a new language. It saw its first public release about three years later, at the end of 1995. So happy 20th birthday to ruby, and a tip of the hat to Matz and all on ruby core who've worked hard on it since then.

Hopefully well see another big event today---the release of ruby-2.0. This is a release that's been years in the making. Version 2.0 has a strong theme, and that's _convention_---2.0 formalises useful conventions that us rubyists have grown to use, and it judiciously adds language features to address bad conventions.

I spoke at [RubyConf AU](http://www.rubyconf.org.au) on Friday about these changes. Here's a run-down, with some quick examples for the language changes---but first, a quick list of some more specific changes.
